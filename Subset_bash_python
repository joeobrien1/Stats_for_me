bedToBigBed v. 2.7 - Convert bed file to bigBed. (BigBed version: 4)
usage:
   bedToBigBed in.bed chrom.sizes out.bb
Where in.bed is in one of the ascii bed formats, but not including track lines
and chrom.sizes is a two-column file/URL: <chromosome name> <size in bases>
and out.bb is the output indexed big bed file.
If the assembly <db> is hosted by UCSC, chrom.sizes can be a URL like
  http://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/<db>/bigZips/<db>.chrom.sizes
or you may use the script fetchChromSizes to download the chrom.sizes file.
If not hosted by UCSC, a chrom.sizes file can be generated by running
twoBitInfo on the assembly .2bit file.
The in.bed file must be sorted by chromosome,start,
  to sort a bed file, use the unix sort command:
     sort -k1,1 -k2,2n unsorted.bed > sorted.bed
Sorting must be set to skip Unicode mapping (LC_COLLATE=C).

options:
   -type=bedN[+[P]] : 
                      N is between 3 and 15, 
                      optional (+) if extra "bedPlus" fields, 
                      optional P specifies the number of extra fields. Not required, but preferred.
                      Examples: -type=bed6 or -type=bed6+ or -type=bed6+3 
                      (see http://genome.ucsc.edu/FAQ/FAQformat.html#format1)
   -as=fields.as - If you have non-standard "bedPlus" fields, it's great to put a definition
                   of each field in a row in AutoSql format here.
   -blockSize=N - Number of items to bundle in r-tree.  Default 256
   -itemsPerSlot=N - Number of data points bundled at lowest level. Default 512
   -unc - If set, do not use compression.
   -tab - If set, expect fields to be tab separated, normally
           expects white space separator.
   -extraIndex=fieldList - If set, make an index on each field in a comma separated list
           extraIndex=name and extraIndex=name,id are commonly used.
   -sizesIs2Bit  -- If set, the chrom.sizes file is assumed to be a 2bit file.
   -udcDir=/path/to/udcCacheDir  -- sets the UDC cache dir for caching of remote files.

liftOver - Move annotations from one assembly to another
usage:
   liftOver oldFile map.chain newFile unMapped
oldFile and newFile are in bed format by default, but can be in GFF and
maybe eventually others with the appropriate flags below.
The map.chain file has the old genome as the target and the new genome
as the query.

         if you are lifting between different organisms. If there has
         been a rearrangement in one of the species, the size of the

   -multiple               Allow multiple output regions
   -noSerial               In -multiple mode, do not put a serial number in the 5th BED column
   -minChainT, -minChainQ  Minimum chain size in target/query, when mapping

         if you are lifting between different organisms. If there has
         been a rearrangement in one of the species, the size of the
         region being mapped may change dramatically after mapping.
***********************************************************************

options:
   -minMatch=0.N Minimum ratio of bases that must remap. Default 0.95
   -gff  File is in gff/gtf format.  Note that the gff lines are converted
         separately.  It would be good to have a separate check after this
         that the lines that make up a gene model still make a plausible gene
         after liftOver
   -genePred - File is in genePred format
   -sample - File is in sample format
   -bedPlus=N - File is bed N+ format (i.e. first N fields conform to bed format)
   -positions - File is in browser "position" format
   -hasBin - File has bin value (used only with -bedPlus)
   -tab - Separate by tabs rather than space (used only with -bedPlus)
   -pslT - File is in psl format, map target side only
   -ends=N - Lift the first and last N bases of each record and combine the
             result. This is useful for lifting large regions like BAC end pairs.
   -minBlocks=0.N Minimum ratio of alignment blocks or exons that must map
                  (default 1.00)
   -fudgeThick    (bed 12 or 12+ only) If thickStart/thickEnd is not mapped,
                  use the closest mapped base.  Recommended if using 
                  -minBlocks.
   -multiple               Allow multiple output regions
   -noSerial               In -multiple mode, do not put a serial number in the 5th BED column
   -minChainT, -minChainQ  Minimum chain size in target/query, when mapping
                           to multiple output regions (default 0, 0)
   -minSizeT               deprecated synonym for -minChainT (ENCODE compat.)
   -minSizeQ               Min matching region size in query with -multiple.
   -chainTable             Used with -multiple, format is db.tablename,
                               to extend chains from net (preserves dups)
   -errorHelp              Explain error messages
